Do androids dream of them?

I want to use this project to explore the implementation and design of swarm behaviour. 

Initial design goals:
 - 2D implementation of basic swarm behaviour (defined as movement in a group, diffusion when swarm too compact and clustering when too spread out)
 
 
 Further:
 - More complex swarm behaviour (threat detection and avoidance, goal seeking)
 -3D space
